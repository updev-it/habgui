# OpenHAB GUI

OpenHAB GUI is a project I started to serve because I was in need of a framework to build a nice web based UI for OpenHAB. I intend to run this web app on a samll (Raspberry Pi 4) computer attached to a touch panel.

## Installation

Clone this GitHub repo into a local folder. Don't forget to checkout the appropriate branch with the latest version. At the time of this writing that will be the `dev` branch.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/updev-it/habgui.git
```

Then use `npm` or `yarn` to install all dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

or

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Usage

Use `npm run start` or `yarn start` to build and fire-up a small local webserver.
